# Interactive Twelvefold Way

## Summary:
Interactive Twelvefold Way is an app that lets users visualize and practice on the Twelvefold Way, a systematic classification of twelve formulas relating to two finite sets in Combinatorics. The best way to visualize each formula is through balls and bins (and for some formulas: stars and bars). Users are prompted to a screen where they can choose which formula to practice on. They are then presented a problem with k number of balls and n number of bins (numbers can be adjustable). They can click and drag on the balls and place them to each bin and submit when they have a partition. Users will solve the problem if they can manage to get all the required partitions.

## Technologies and Languages
* JavaScript
* Canvas
* MathJax

## Future Features
* Different hints for all formulas
* Show a configuration by finding an available configuration and automatically arrange all balls based on it.
* Show the solution by calculating all correct configurations and showing them on the history.
* Incorporating physics for balls/bars using Matter.js
