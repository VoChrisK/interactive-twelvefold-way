# Interactive Twelvefold Way

## Summary:
Interactive Twelvefold Way is an app that lets users visualize and practice on the Twelvefold Way, a systematic classification of twelve formulas relating to two finite sets in Combinatorics. The best way to visualize each formula is through balls and bins (and for some formulas: stars and bars). Users are prompted to a screen where they can choose which formula to practice on. They are then presented a problem with k number of balls and n number of bins (numbers can be adjustable). They can click and drag on the balls and place them to each bin and submit when they have a partition. Users will solve the problem if they can manage to get all the required partitions.

## Functionalities and MVPs
* Implementing combinatorical logic for balls and bins
* Implementing interactivity and physics to balls
* Keeping track of partitions
* Buttom to reset state
* Button to show solution and to auto-solve the problem
* Implementing information about each formula, how to approach said formula, and maybe hints
